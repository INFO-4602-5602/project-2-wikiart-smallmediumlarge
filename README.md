<h2>Storytelling with Data</h2>

Apparently this option doesn't require a README???

<ul>
<li> Create a website containing four visualizations that illustrates interesting features of the data. </li>
  <li>Include at least four unique visualizations:
  <ul>
  <li>One visualization must include some quantitative data</li>
  <li>One visualization must include categorical data</li>
  <li>Your visualizations should support at least one meaningful comparison between related data attributes</li>
  <li>Your visualizations should each be accompanied by text explaining what the visualization shows. Note what tasks the visualization allows you to accomplish to derive this insight and how your design is tailored to support these tasks.
</ul></li>
  <li>Include as a part of your website a section or page with the following details:
  <ul>
  <li>Information about your data preprocessing and design as appropriate.  </li>
  <li>Your design process (e.g., how did you go about designing, building, and refining your system? Why did you choose these representations?)</li>
    <li>Any additional elements of the project you consider "above and beyond" the basic requirements.</li>
  <li>Your team roles for each individual</li>
 </ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Above and Beyond:</h3> 
The above requirements are the minimum for a passing grade on this project. Some ideas to improve your project include (but are not limited to):<ul>
<li>Unusual Representations: Draw on some of the examples from class to represent data in ways beyond a typical scatterplot or bar chart.</li>
<li>Style: Keep the style consistent across all your views, with an eye towards intelligently applying visual design.</li>
<li>Interesting Tasks: Derive insight into the data. Highlight these insights in your readme and describe how the visualization enables them. What do these insights tell us about the data? </li>
<li>Perceptually-Informed Design: Integrate perceptual concepts into your visualization design and discuss how you've integrated those concepts.</li>
<li>Integrate Imagery: Use data from the provided URLs to add more context to your visualization. For example, you could link to or include text about individual paintings or artists or integrate images of the art into your visualizations.</li>
<li>Coordinated Views: Use visualizations that complement one another in meaningful ways to tell a deeper story than they otherwise could on their own.</li></ul>

<h3>Platforms:</h3> 
You can use any tools or platforms you'd like to create your visualizations. Your webpage should run in the browser without me having to install any additional software. 


<h2>Submissions:</h2>
All submissions must be made through GitHub with a timestamp by 11:59pm on 12.2. Your submission files should include:
<ul>
<li>Your code and/or website</li>
<li>Your README (for Option 1)</li>
</ul>
Note that each group only needs to submit one file. <br/>

This project would typically be conducted over a two-week timeline, which would give you more time to focus on your final projects. However, I do not want to require people to work over the break. Given the pending break and final projects, I will give up to 5 bonus points to teams that submit their projects early. Starting November 27, you will get one bonus point per day early. As GitHub allows you to submit continuously, please send me an email (one per group with all team members CC'ed) after submiting your project (commit AND push) letting me know you've submitted your project early to receive the bonus points.
