			<h1>art history</h1>
			<p>
				Art history offers a serious glance into the past by helping us look at some of the most revealing attributes of a time period. Not only are we able to gather feeling and emotions from a period of time, we can gather contextual clues to fascinations of the time, influential people of the time, as well as leading ideologies.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here we have different comparisons on various aspects within the data for each of the four most influential time periods of art history: the Renaissance, the Post-Renaissance, the Contemporary period, and the Modern Art period. At the bottom is also each of the visualizations grouped by their respective styles for an overview of what art was like during that time period.

			<h1>art subjects: presence of bodies or faces</h1>
			<p>
				An interesting starting place in analyzing art-history can begin with subject matters. The human form has consistently proven to be an important subject matter within history, as can be seen through the following four visualizations. We see as time moved forward into the modern and contemporary eras of art history, the common interest shifted as well. Looked at point-blank, we can see that the art world took a consistently decreasing jump away from focusing on the ‘face’ and ‘body’ towards the experimental and unfamiliar. Potentially our environments, scientific discoveries, and broad artistic explorations such as cubism, surfacing within the Modernist period of art. This can potentially be attributed to our growing human knowledge that continues to increase and blossom beyond that of the human form.

					title="Evidently, the face was generally the most popular topic of work within the Renaissance, bringing light to the commonality of portraiture within Renaissance pieces such as “Saint Ivo” by Rogier van der Weyden and “A Young Lady of Fashion” by Paolo Uceello for example. The heavy number of pieces thematically based around the face help us to understand that the Renaissance was a time period in which commissioned artworks were the livelihood of an artist's career. Only the wealthy and important could afford to commission works, and therefore rose the importance and popularity of portraiture within the Renaissance period." />
				</div>
				<div class="viz2">
					<img src="vizImages/postRenaissance2.png" class="vizImg"
					title="While the Renaissance focused on beauty and harmony, the Post Renaissance was chock full of different artistic movements such as Rococo, Baroque, and Neoclassical Art, shifting between taboo subjects, architecture, realism and beyond. While portraiture still thrived within the Post Renaissance, we feel an element of realism over idealism extended as the body is more heavily introduced into scenes, proved by pieces such as “Portrait of A Young Married Couple” by Jacob Jordeans. The beginnings of a shift towards more experimental pieces of art with non-commissioned work, as well as scenes that begin to focus on non-human subjects come to rise as well, seen in pieces such as “Still Life of Fruit” by Osias Beert." />
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="visContainer">
				<div class="viz2">
					<img src="vizImages/modern2.png" class="vizImg"
					title="Traditions of the past are proven to be typically disregarded within Modern Art, as artists focus on truly experiment and expressionistic pieces that are far less likely to be commissioned, and more likely to focus on the exploration of techniques, such as that of the expedition of light within Impressionism, seen in works such as “Three Dancers in An Exercise Hall” by Edgar Degas. Although some humanistic elements were retained, there were also movements such as Cubism and Abstract Art, where human subjects are rarely visibly the focus, seen in “Landscape” by Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso as well as “Nature Symbolized” by Arthur Dove." />
				</div>
				<div class="viz2">
					<img src="vizImages/contemporary2.png" class="vizImg"
					title="Contemporary is the most ‘abstracted’ art has come. This involves more sculptural, multimedia, and technology driven experimentation during art. As much of these mediums are fairly new and advancing, so is that of the everchanging Contemporary Art. Entirely experimental, and rarely relying on the conventional, as seen in earlier generations of art. For this reason we see the almost full coverage of neither face nor body represented within the art. Typically emotions, feelings, and ideas are far more likely to find themselves represented within Contemporary Art, as seen in works such as “Skyviewing Sculpture” by Noguchi Isamu." />

			<h1>art emotions: emotions depicted over time</h1>
			<p>
				Diving deeper, we can look into the general emotion of a time period to help us contextualize a mood of an era. This helps us generate deeper questions about the events that lead to these emotions, as well as the categorical trends that came from it. We see the leading emotions such as ‘Trust’ and ‘Surprise’ in later movements butting heads, as their meanings contrast. Not only can we get a general sense of the contextual emotions of the time periods from the Renaissance to the Modern Art period, but we can investigate trends within the periods themselves to give us a deeper look into events that may have changed the course of art history, by correlating the spikes and their respective years.

		<div class="section" id="artistRatings">
			<h1>art creators: ratings of individual artists</h1>
			<p>
				By analyzing the ratings of top artists of the times, not only are we able to get a glance at some of the most influential artists within each historical period, but we are able to take away some of the most influential artists of all time. Though we notice the renaissance holds a reasonable number of artists from which we can easily glance at and understand, the large increase in contributors to the artists pools within the Post-Renaissance and Modern Art period, work to demonstrate the open and expressive qualities of each movement to shift away from a popularized group of artists, and towards a larger creative evolution for the people.

		<div class="section" id="christianity">
			<h1>art influences: pieces related to christianity</h1>
			<p>
				Possibly one of the most significant clues into the culture of a civilization involves the present ideologies. Christian iconography is one of the most symbolistically relevant themes within art history. Here, we investigate within each time period, where there are the largest number of references to Christianity, as well as the differences within each respective time period. We see a general downward trend of the presence of Christian references within titles as artistic time periods move forwards, as peoples scientific knowledge as well as general acceptance for unlikely opinions expanded.
