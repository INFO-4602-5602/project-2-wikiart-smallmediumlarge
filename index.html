			<h1>art history</h1>
			<p>
				Art history offers a serious glance into the past by helping us look at some of the most revealing attributes of a time period. Not only are we able to gather feeling and emotions from a period of time, we can gather contextual clues to fascinations of the time, influential people of the time, as well as leading ideologies.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here we have different comparisons on various aspects within the data for each of the four most influential time periods of art history: the Renaissance, the Post-Renaissance, the Contemporary period, and the Modern Art period. At the bottom is also each of the visualizations grouped by their respective styles for an overview of what art was like during that time period.

			<h1>art subjects: presence of bodies or faces</h1>
			<p>
				An interesting starting place in analyzing art-history can begin with subject matters. The human form has consistently proven to be an important subject matter within history, as can be seen through the following four visualizations. We see as time moved forward into the modern and contemporary eras of art history, the common interest shifted as well. Looked at point-blank, we can see that the art world took a consistently decreasing jump away from focusing on the ‘face’ and ‘body’ towards the experimental and unfamiliar. Potentially our environments, scientific discoveries, and broad artistic explorations such as cubism, surfacing within the Modernist period of art. This can potentially be attributed to our growing human knowledge that continues to increase and blossom beyond that of the human form.

					title="Evidently, the face was generally the most popular topic of work within the Renaissance, bringing light to the commonality of portraiture within Renaissance pieces such as “Saint Ivo” by Rogier van der Weyden and “A Young Lady of Fashion” by Paolo Uceello for example. The heavy number of pieces thematically based around the face help us to understand that the Renaissance was a time period in which commissioned artworks were the livelihood of an artist's career. Only the wealthy and important could afford to commission works, and therefore rose the importance and popularity of portraiture within the Renaissance period." />
				</div>
				<div class="viz2">
					<img src="vizImages/postRenaissance2.png" class="vizImg"
					title="While the Renaissance focused on beauty and harmony, the Post Renaissance was chock full of different artistic movements such as Rococo, Baroque, and Neoclassical Art, shifting between taboo subjects, architecture, realism and beyond. While portraiture still thrived within the Post Renaissance, we feel an element of realism over idealism extended as the body is more heavily introduced into scenes, proved by pieces such as “Portrait of A Young Married Couple” by Jacob Jordeans. The beginnings of a shift towards more experimental pieces of art with non-commissioned work, as well as scenes that begin to focus on non-human subjects come to rise as well, seen in pieces such as “Still Life of Fruit” by Osias Beert." />
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="visContainer">
				<div class="viz2">
					<img src="vizImages/modern2.png" class="vizImg"
					title="Traditions of the past are proven to be typically disregarded within Modern Art, as artists focus on truly experiment and expressionistic pieces that are far less likely to be commissioned, and more likely to focus on the exploration of techniques, such as that of the expedition of light within Impressionism, seen in works such as “Three Dancers in An Exercise Hall” by Edgar Degas. Although some humanistic elements were retained, there were also movements such as Cubism and Abstract Art, where human subjects are rarely visibly the focus, seen in “Landscape” by Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso as well as “Nature Symbolized” by Arthur Dove." />
				</div>
				<div class="viz2">
					<img src="vizImages/contemporary2.png" class="vizImg"
					title="Contemporary is the most ‘abstracted’ art has come. This involves more sculptural, multimedia, and technology driven experimentation during art. As much of these mediums are fairly new and advancing, so is that of the everchanging Contemporary Art. Entirely experimental, and rarely relying on the conventional, as seen in earlier generations of art. For this reason we see the almost full coverage of neither face nor body represented within the art. Typically emotions, feelings, and ideas are far more likely to find themselves represented within Contemporary Art, as seen in works such as “Skyviewing Sculpture” by Noguchi Isamu." />

			<h1>art emotions: emotions depicted over time</h1>
			<p>
				Diving deeper, we can look into the general emotion of a time period to help us contextualize a mood of an era. This helps us generate deeper questions about the events that lead to these emotions, as well as the categorical trends that came from it. We see the leading emotions such as ‘Trust’ and ‘Surprise’ in later movements butting heads, as their meanings contrast. Not only can we get a general sense of the contextual emotions of the time periods from the Renaissance to the Modern Art period, but we can investigate trends within the periods themselves to give us a deeper look into events that may have changed the course of art history, by correlating the spikes and their respective years.
			</p>
			<div class="visContainer">
				<div class="viz1">
					<img src="vizImages/renaissance1.png" class="vizImg"
					title="As characterized in this visualization, we see that ‘Trust' was the overwhelming emotion brought forth in Renaissance works. This is relevant as we connect it to the scientific truths, beauties, and mysteries of the human and natural world as a reaction to classical antiquity pieces. Much of this ‘Truth’ can be linked to the ideologies of the time, as many pieces were religious in nature, such as classic “The Last Supper” by Leonardo da Vinci. Peaks within different periods of the Renaissance help us to understand that pieces in this period of art were generally pleasant to look at, filled with the adoration of the natural world, and biblical truths. We can begin to correlate the number of paintings related to the face (in the previous visualization) to the emotion ‘Truth’ since the human face is something all find familiar and trustworthy." />
				</div>
				<div class="viz1">
					<img src="vizImages/postRenaissance1.png" class="vizImg"
					title="The Post Renaissance was filled with remarkably different artistic movements from Baroque to Romanticism. The differences in these artistic movements are reflective in the emotional spikes displayed within our visualization. We see overwhelming ‘Happiness’, however there are times when ‘Trust’, ‘Love’, and ‘Fear’ make peak appearances as well. In link to artistic time periods, we are able to see the initial period of ‘Happiness’ correlated to Baroque works such as “Two Musicians” by Judith Leyster. On the other hand, our spike in ‘Trust’ can be easily correlated to the “Rococo” period, where more face-related pieces arose seen in works such as “The White Hat” by Jean-Baptiste Greuze." />
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="visContainer">
				<div class="viz1">
					<img src="vizImages/modern1.png" class="vizImg"
					title="As seen in the previous visualization for Modern Art, subject matters were rarely consistent. This in turn, is reflective of the various number of emotionally spikes and shifts throughout the age. We see a spike off ‘Sadness’ reflected within Impressionist and Post-Impressionist pieces such as “Starry Night” by Vincent Van Gogh and “Sick Boy (Bambino malato)” by Medardo Rosso. Surprise and Anticipation are on the rise through later generations of Modern Art, such as Abstract Art, where emotionally experimentation was on the rise. This is evident in works such as “The Conjurer” by Hans Hoffman, which when looked at abruptly, appears as nothing more than a series of paint splatters." />
				</div>
				<div class="viz1">
					<img src="vizImages/contemporary1.png" class="vizImg"
					title="As seen within the previous visualization regarding the typical content seen within contemporary work, we know the artistic period was a true expansion beyond everything we had previously been familiar with. This is reflective in the emotion “Surprise” respondents had consistently reacted with throughout the entirety of the 20 year period. These pieces were all but familiar to the understanding of the common viewer, which contributed to general emotions of surprise and anticipation. One example of this was the abruptly shocking shift from a world of hundreds of small brush strokes in impressionism, to the minimalist trend within the Contemporary period. To understand what the viewers may have felt, take a look at impressionist pieces such as “Three Dancers in An Exercise Hall” by Edgar Degas and compare them to Contemporary pieces such as Slack of Net by Takamatsu Jira, which displays nothing more than a net, displayed on a wall." />

			<h1>art creators: ratings of individual artists</h1>
			<p>
				By analyzing the ratings of top artists of the times, not only are we able to get a glance at some of the most influential artists within each historical period, but we are able to take away some of the most influential artists of all time. Though we notice the renaissance holds a reasonable number of artists from which we can easily glance at and understand, the large increase in contributors to the artists pools within the Post-Renaissance and Modern Art period, work to demonstrate the open and expressive qualities of each movement to shift away from a popularized group of artists, and towards a larger creative evolution for the people.

		<div class="section" id="christianity">
			<h1>art influences: pieces related to christianity</h1>
			<p>
				Possibly one of the most significant clues into the culture of a civilization involves the present ideologies. Christian iconography is one of the most symbolistically relevant themes within art history. Here, we investigate within each time period, where there are the largest number of references to Christianity, as well as the differences within each respective time period. We see a general downward trend of the presence of Christian references within titles as artistic time periods move forwards, as peoples scientific knowledge as well as general acceptance for unlikely opinions expanded.

			<div class="visContainer">
				<div class="viz4">
					<img src="vizImages/renaissance4.png" class="vizImg"
					title="We see the largest portion of Christian related pieces within the Renaissance, potentially linked to the most relevant emotion being “Trust”. Not only are we able to see the Renaissance as a prime context clue into the time period, but we are able to dissect into the time period. and see that the Northern Renaissance had the largest number of relevant pieces, however as the Renaissance time period grew later in time, the number of Christian pieces shrunk in number." />
				</div>
				<div class="viz4">
					<img src="vizImages/postRenaissance4.png" class="vizImg"
					title="Reflective of the Renaissance’s previous visualization, as time progressed, the number of Christianity-related work decreased. This trend continues on through the Post-Renaissance. We are able to see that each one of these time periods was focused less on religion, and more on the exploration of other aspects of the human experience, this is also somewhat reflective of the previous visualization regarding the change in emotion." />

			</div>
			<div class="visContainer">
				<div class="viz4">
					<img src="vizImages/modern4.png" class="vizImg"
					title="Not only does this visualization continue the trend of shrinking the number of Christian related works, but it works to visually display the extreme variance and boom in artistic experimentation within the age. Not only are we able to see the general size comparison of Christian related works to non-Christian related works, however we are able to see the popularity of artistic trends, those who thrived. Interestingly, of those who did seem to ‘thrive’ they did so somewhat equally." />
				</div>
				<div class="viz4">
					<img src="vizImages/contemporary4.png" class="vizImg"
					title="Within this visualization we see non-Christian related works completely consuming Christian related works. We can see a general trend of consistency throughout the other visualizations. Generally a shocking, minimalist approach unrelated to Christ, the human face, or body. These visualizations help to explore the Contemporary periods exploratory finesse at its finest." />
