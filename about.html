			<h1>data pre-processing</h1>
			<p>
				To execute the visualization ideas we had in mind, a bit of data processing and analysis was done to get the values or format needed, resulting in numerous sets of .csv files.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first set of .csv’s contain data from the original cleaned file separated out by style. The categories found within Style included: Renaissance, Post-Renaissance, Post-Renaissance / Modern, Modern, Modern / Contemporary, and Contemporary, but out of these 6 styles, Post-Renaissance / Modern and Modern / Contemporary were left out due to their small datasets of 7 and 1 painting(s) respectively, leaving the final project with: Renaissance, Post-Renaissance, Modern, and Contemporary as the main styles.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second set of .csv’s created was the data on artist rating averages. Within each style’s own dataframe, rows were uniquely categorized by artist names and the columns for mean rating and all of the following emotions were averaged for their respective artist. The dataset rows were then sorted by average Mean rating descending, and the first 15 rows were taken for an analysis on a style's "top 15 artists".
			</p>
			<p>
				An additional column we added to the data include the analysis of art pieces any religious connections they had to Christianity. For this analysis, the provided Title for each piece was checked to see if the string contained any keywords that were closely related to Christianity. Pieces that did contain keywords were marked with a yes, and pieces that did not contain keywords were marked with a no. The keywords searched can be found in <a href="https://github.com/INFO-4602-5602/project-2-wikiart-smallmediumlarge/blob/master/customCSVs/ChristianityKeyWords.csv" target="_blank">ChristianityKeyWords.csv on the GitHub</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				All data processing was done in Python with Pandas.
