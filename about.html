			<h1>data pre-processing</h1>
			<p>
				To execute the visualization ideas we had in mind, a bit of data processing and analysis was done to get the values or format needed, resulting in numerous sets of .csv files.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first set of .csv’s contain data from the original cleaned file separated out by style. The categories found within Style included: Renaissance, Post-Renaissance, Post-Renaissance / Modern, Modern, Modern / Contemporary, and Contemporary, but out of these 6 styles, Post-Renaissance / Modern and Modern / Contemporary were left out due to their small datasets of 7 and 1 painting(s) respectively, leaving the final project with: Renaissance, Post-Renaissance, Modern, and Contemporary as the main styles.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second set of .csv’s created was the data on artist rating averages. Within each style’s own dataframe, rows were uniquely categorized by artist names and the columns for mean rating and all of the following emotions were averaged for their respective artist. The dataset rows were then sorted by average Mean rating descending, and the first 15 rows were taken for an analysis on a style's "top 15 artists".
			</p>
			<p>
				An additional column we added to the data include the analysis of art pieces any religious connections they had to Christianity. For this analysis, the provided Title for each piece was checked to see if the string contained any keywords that were closely related to Christianity. Pieces that did contain keywords were marked with a yes, and pieces that did not contain keywords were marked with a no. The keywords searched can be found in <a href="https://github.com/INFO-4602-5602/project-2-wikiart-smallmediumlarge/blob/master/customCSVs/ChristianityKeyWords.csv" target="_blank">ChristianityKeyWords.csv on the GitHub</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				All data processing was done in Python with Pandas.

				The Mohammad & Kiritchenko study posed many interesting questions and delves into an enormous amount of history and data. The study gathered paintings from as far back as the early 1400s to the present day, covering the majority of our history. Art has the ability to capture history in a raw and revealing way while also preserving facts; it also has many other characteristics like self expression, conveying emotion, telling a story, or expressing beliefs. 
</p><p>
While looking over the findings from the Mohammad & Kiritchenko study, we noticed that the majority of the paintings fell into either the Renaissance, Post-Renaissance, Modern, or Contemporary art era. Because these art pieces covered a vast majority of different time frames, we thought it would be interesting to look at how people's emotions, popular artists, religion, and characteristic shown in the paintings varied over time focused on specific stylic periods. 
</p><p>
The characteristics we wanted to compare came from the Mohammad & Kiritchenko study concerning whether or not the painting contained an image of a face, a body, or none (mostly meaning a scenic painting rather than of a person). We were curious to see if there was a variation in specific stylic periods of what content artists were painting, face versus body or none. We decided this data would best be represented in a pie chart because it would allow us to initially see what characteristics were the most prominent in each individual time period, and then compare these percentages across multiple time frames. 
</p><p>
Our next intriguing question was to look into the moods and emotions of each time. Watching the trends and emotive tendencies of the periods helped us not only see the most typical ‘emotion’ of a time period, but helped us contextualize different moods that occured within the time periods IE) the general mood of Impressionism within the Modern Art period. We decided line graphs graphing each responded emotion over the time period would help us track the trends as well as track when specific emotions were on the rise. Color coating the emotions gave an easy representation for the viewer to follow thanks to the key provided. 
</p><p>
Following, we decided to create a visual regarding the top 15 artists in each time period. Not only did this help us tell a contextual story about the influential artists of the time, but when connected to the artists’ respective pieces helps us understand popular pieces within a timeframe. We chose to represent this data using a simple bar graph with quantitative ratings along the y-axis. We felt this was the clearest and most easily-understandable approach to this data attribute. 
</p><p>
Our final visualization took a look at Christianity related titles in artwork. We felt this piece was important as it aids in the contextual clues of a time period. The way people think as well as the scientific knowledge, progress, and beyond are told from pieces of art. Art are after all artifacts. To help us gain insight on this, we decided to create bubble charts comparing the number of Christianity related titles to non-Christianity related titles, all dissected within either the Renaissance, Post-Renaissance, Modern, and Contemporary periods. We accomplished this by generating a list of keywords which the piece titles would circulate through. This helps the viewer gain insight that is not otherwise easy to see or find quickly.

				<b>Unusual Representations:</b> We represented our data in a unique way by creating our entire website in a timeline fashion, while also including additional visualizations to dig deeper into specific time frames. We worked to create 4 completely different visual representations, as well as organized them in two different ways (similar graphs side by side and time period graphs side by side) in order to offer the viewer a larger window of insight. 
</p><p>
<b>Style: </b>We worked to keep a consistent style with the viewer's ability to view 4 identical charts side by side, changed only by the data of the respective time periods. This helps the viewer gain insight quickly by comparison. To appeal to the viewer, descriptions are revealed when hovered in the tooltip, so the page is not cluttered with words, and feels more organized in nature. Photographs enlarged with hover in order to appeal to an attractive design. 
</p><p>
<b>Interesting Tasks: </b>Specific insight was designed to be found within respective tooltips. Tooltips on hover, were created for each and every visualization respectively in order to give the viewer a clear context and supplementary ‘story’ whilst viewing the visualization. 
</p><p>
<b>Perceptually-Informed Design:</b> We used several perceptual tactics within this project, the most obvious being Gestalt Grouping. Grouping is utilized not just within each and every visualization (via color and shape), but is utilized within the entire organization of the website. We have chosen to group the visualizations by similarity of visualization (face/body, emotions, artists, and religion) as well as by time period grouped together at the bottom. 
</p><p>
<b>Integrate Imagery: </b>Specific artworks, artists, art-movements and related attributes are referred to in each tooltip. This is used in order to give the viewer contextual background to help understand each time periods. One example used was “Three Dancers in An Exercise Hall” by Edgar Degas to help explain Impressionist artwork within the  Contemporary emotion tooltip. 
</p><p>
<b>Coordinated Views:</b> Storytelling elements are incorporated throughout the 4 visualization trends and are expanded upon within the tooltips. Unique and interesting perspectives are brought up, such as how ‘Trust’ is the overwhelming emotion for the Renaissance, as well as the tendency for Christian art to be a theme in this time period. The connection between these two for example, can be found within the respective tooltips.
